This paper uses exploratory data analysis to discover the most likely causes of Toronto Fire Service (TFS) firefighter casualties between 2011 to 2019. Using Open Data Toronto's fire incident dataset, the paper exposes that the majority of firefighter casualties occured at residential fires, during the winter months, and when the fire had already spread beyond of object of origin when the first unit arrived on scene. Although the TFS is one of the few Canadian fire departments with declining firefighter causality rates, the results demonstrate where the TFS can take proactive steps and develop timely interventions to create safer operational environments and further reduce firefighter casualties.
